## Important notes
- Create your project in `vivado_project` directory
- While adding sources, make sure to include directories and select to **NOT** copy them into your project (leave the checkbox at the end of the window unchecket)
- In Vivado's Source File Properties make sure that the file is located at `*\<project or repository name>\src\*` and **NOT** in `*\<project or repository name>\vivado_project\*.srcs\*` directory
- When creating new sources, create then in `*\<project or repository name>\src\*` and **NOT** in default `<local to project>`
