# de1-project - I2C communication

## Important notes
- Create your project in `vivado_project` directory
- While adding sources, make sure to include directories and select to **NOT** copy them into your project (leave the checkbox at the end of the window unchecket)
- In Vivado's Source File Properties make sure that the file is located at `*\<project or repository name>\src\*` and **NOT** in `*\<project or repository name>\vivado_project\*.srcs\*` directory
- When creating new sources, create then in `*\<project or repository name>\src\*` and **NOT** in default `<local to project>`

## Documentation

### Clock gen
The clock_gen module generates a clock signal at a specified frequency by dividing a 100 MHz input clock. It outputs a signal that toggles at a 50% duty cycle, effectively producing a square wave at the desired frequency. This output is used as a timing signal (e.g., 400 kHz or 1 Hz) for other modules requiring a slower clock domain.
This block uses a synchronous counter to toggle the output clock enable signal, and it does not have an external reset.

### Seg drive
The seg drive module is a synchronous module used to dislplay meassured temperature using 7 out of 8 availiable 7-segment display units with non floating decimal point. Module is able to display values in range +-99.9999. 

Input value is represented by integer value that contains actual value multiplied by 10^4 (e.g., 256365 for 25.6365). Module mathematically separates digits of input number and displays them on individual units using upgraded 7-segment driver from classes with 400 kHz refresh rate.

### ADT7420 driver

### I2C driver
I2C driver establishes communication between ADT7420 driver and the sensor itself. The code is separated into 3 processes which are sensitive to clock signal generated by clock_gen module:
- rising_process is sensitive to rising edge of the clock signal and its responsible for switching between states (FSM), reading data from both slave and master, and increasing iterative signals as counter or read_counter.
- falling_process on the other hand based on conditional statements and iterative signals changes SDA_drive and SCL_drive signals between '0' a 'Z' ('Z' stands for released bus).
- If a signal disable_auto_SCL is set to '0' p_SCL_driver updates the SCL_drive according to the signal from clock_gen, otherwise SCL is set to 'Z'.
- SDA <= SDA_drive and SCL <= SCL_drive updates SDA and SCL outputs.
